narada-setup-cron (any may be others too) doesn't complain when run
not in project root dir.

Replace dependency on mutt in `narada-patch-send` with Email::Sender and
POWER::GPG (release it to CPAN first).

BUG Plugins are currently broken: if they contain *.42.pl which convert
database, then it must be run on each deployment - i.e. each plugin's
patch must be released as separate patch on project, several plugin's
patches shouldn't be combined in one massive project's update (at least,
automatically).
