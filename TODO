narada-setup-cron (any may be others too) doesn't complain when run
not in project root dir.

Replace dependency on mutt in `narada-patch-send` with Email::Sender and
POWER::GPG (release it to CPAN first).

BUG Plugins are currently broken: if they contain *.42.pl which convert
database, then it must be run on each deployment - i.e. each plugin's
patch must be released as separate patch on project, several plugin's
patches shouldn't be combined in one massive project's update (at least,
automatically).

FIXME Test/add Innodb support (mysqldump tests which pass on MyISAM are
fails on Innodb).

`narada-new`::
  - write into `config/version` version without leading zeroes: "0.1.0",
    for semver compatiblity
  - remove project name from `config/version` - looks like it doesn't have
    any real use (as project name)
  - update doc

`narada-release`::
  - if `config/version` match `/\A\d+\.\d+\.\d+\z/`, then instead of
    incrementing last number in string instead increment second and set
    third to zero (for semver compatiblity)
