=head1 NAME

narada-backup - prepare consistent project backup


=head1 VERSION

This document describes narada-backup version v1.4.4


=head1 USAGE

    narada-backup


=head1 DESCRIPTION

At first run prepare full project backup in 'var/backup/full.tar'.
On next runs prepare incremental backup in 'var/backup/incr.tar' plus
append it to full backup in 'var/backup/full.tar' (using tar -A).

Because of used technique of quick full backup update, full backup will
grow on each run. To keep file with full backup on reasonable size, you
should force full backup from time to time.

To force full backup you should remove 'var/backup/full.tar' before running
narada-backup.

Both full and incremental backups should be unpacked as incremental tar
archives, see http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/tar/Incremental-Dumps.html.

Before preparing backup will run narada-mysqldump.

Files and directories listed in config/backup/exclude (use syntax suitable
for tar's --exclude option) will not be included in backup.

Will exit with non-zero exit status if backup process failed.

Script must be executed only from "project root directory".
