narada-shutdown-services - kill services and their supervisors


=head1 VERSION

This document describes narada-shutdown-services version v1.4.4


=head1 USAGE

    narada-shutdown-services


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Script must be executed only from "project root directory".

Service supervisors usually started by cron, and may continue working
even after project directory will be removed - with undefined result.

So, if you want to stop and/or delete project you should run this command
after C<narada-setup-cron --clean> to make sure all project services are
not running anymore and won't start again.


=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

None.
